In total, we conducted 108 experiments based on the three traffic disturbance scenarios outlined in the JAMA standard: cut-in, cut-out, and

Interested properties (e.g., non-collision, min TTC, perception precision, etc.) can be verified with respect to these traces using AW-Checker. Check [AW-Checker folder](../AW-Checker) for the information.
