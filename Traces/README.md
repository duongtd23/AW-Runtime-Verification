In total, we conducted 108 experiments based on the three traffic disturbance scenarios outlined in the JAMA standard: cut-in, cut-out, and
deceleration scenarios.

Interested properties (e.g., non-collision, min TTC, perception precision, etc.) can be verified with respect to these traces using AW-Checker. Check [AW-Checker folder](../AW-Checker) for the information.

### Update on 2024/01/14
A second run of the cut-out and deceleration experiments have been added.
The traces can be found in [lidar/cutout/second-run](lidar/cutout/second-run), [camera_lidar_fusion/cutout/second-run](camera_lidar_fusion/cutout/second-run)
as well as
[lidar/deceleration/second-run](lidar/deceleration/second-run), [camera_lidar_fusion/deceleration/second-run](camera_lidar_fusion/deceleration/second-run).
